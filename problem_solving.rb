#What do you like about this process?
    #It is always good to have a method to the madness. Trust the process. With a plan, it is easier to achieve the outcome. Without a plan, I am all over the place. 
#What might make this process challenging?
    #It could be more challenging if one does not break down the process into basic pieces, it may be hard to google a long block of information. If you are not specific, you'll get too much information.
#Are there any steps you would add or modify?
    # Take a break if you are struggling. Being frustrated and in a rush does not help.
